Neural Networks &amp; Deep Learning Assignment -4 

# Question - 1:
### a)Imported data set which contains four attributes for further implementation
c)Described the given values using describe keyword
d)Checking therenis a null values in a given dataset
1)Replaced the null values with mean
e)Took two cloumns (Pulse & Calories) and aggregated the values like max,min,count & mean.
f)Filtered the datframe in above given conditions calories values between 500 and 1000
g)Filtered the dataframe with where calories values > 500 and pulse < 100.
h)Dataframe modified with all columns except Maxpulse 
i)Deleted the maxpulse columns in main dataframe using drop keyword
j)Converted the float values to integer of calories column
k)Scatter plot has been created for the Duration and calories columns using matplotlib.pyplot.

# Question - 2:
a) imported the given salary data file
b)This code snippet demonstrates how to split a dataset into training and testing sets using the **train_test_split** function from the **sklearn.model_selection** module.
c)The aboce code demonstrates how to train a linear regression model using the LinearRegression class from the **sklearn.linear_model** module. It then makes predictions on both the training and testing sets.
d)Calculated the mean squared error for above code
e)By Visualizing the above values scatter plot has been created.
